    name: Remove Volumes from your Scene
    description: "<b>\u2022 What It Does:</b> Volumes in Unity (like post-processing
      volumes) add visual effects that can enhance scene realism but also consume
      GPU resources, which may not be necessary in VR where performance is critical.\r\n\r\n<b>\u2022
      Our Modification:</b> We removed all Volume components from the scenes to reduce
      GPU load and improve frame rates, as post-processing effects are often not
      essential in mobile VR experiences."
