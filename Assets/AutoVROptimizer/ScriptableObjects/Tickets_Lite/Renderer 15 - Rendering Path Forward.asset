    name: Set Rendering Path to Forward or Forward +
    description: "\u2022 <b>What It Does:</b> Sets the rendering path for the URP
      pipeline. URP supports two main forward rendering paths:\r\n\r\n<b>Forward:</b>
      A simpler rendering path with lower overhead. It renders each object once per
      light affecting it and supports a limited number of dynamic lights per object.\r\n\r\n<b>Forward+:</b>
      Uses clustered lighting to support more dynamic lights efficiently. It introduces
      a depth pre-pass and additional memory usage for light clustering data.\r\n\r\n\u2022
      <b>Our Modification:</b> We recommend using Forward on Quest to minimize draw
      calls, memory usage, and shader complexity. Forward+ can be useful in rare
      cases where multiple dynamic lights are essential, but it comes at the cost
      of performance and should be tested carefully on mobile VR hardware."
