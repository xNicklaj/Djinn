    name: Keep Render Scale Between 0.85 and 1.2
    description: "<b>\u2022 What It Does:</b> Determines the resolution multiplier
      at which the scene is rendered relative to the device\u2019s native resolution.
      \n\n<b>\u2022 Our Modification: </b>We recommend keeping the Render Scale between
      0.85 and 1.2. A value of 1.0 is already below the headset\u2019s full resolution,
      but increasing it slightly (up to 1.2) can enhance visual clarity if the project
      is well optimized. Conversely, Meta VRCs recommend not going below 0.85, as
      lower values may degrade the visual experience. Always test per scene to maintain
      performance and clarity."
