    description: "<b>\u2022 What It Does:</b> Determines how aggressively unused
      code is removed during the build process.\n\n<b>\u2022 Our Modification:</b>
      We set this to Medium or High to reduce build size and improve loading times.
      However, this setting should be tested carefully, as it may cause issues with
      techniques like Dependency Injection, particularly with frameworks such as
      VContainer that rely on reflection."
